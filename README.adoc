libNEGF
=======

libNEGF is a general library for Non Equilibrium Green's Functions.

With libNEGF you can calculate Equilibrium and Non Equilibrium Green's Function in open systems
and related quantities, within an efficient sparse iterative scheme.

libNEGF is available under LGPL license.

For an example of application, see the use of libNEGF in [dftb+](https://dftbplus.org/)

== Installation

libNEGF requires
* CMake,
* a C99 compiler,
* a Fortran 2018 compiler,
* BLAS,
* LAPACK, and
* MPI 3.

Optionally CUDA can be used.

Note that MPICH version 4 may cause build problems due to the mpifx dependency, see [mpifx#48](https://github.com/dftbplus/mpifx/issues/48).
